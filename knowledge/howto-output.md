# Output from LAMMPS (thermo, dumps, computes, fixes, variables)

There are four basic forms of LAMMPS output:

* [Thermodynamic output](thermo_style), which is a list of
  quantities printed every few timesteps to the screen and logfile.
* [Dump files](dump), which contain snapshots of atoms and various
  per-atom values and are written at a specified frequency.
* Certain fixes can output user-specified quantities to files:
  [fix ave/time](fix_ave_time) for time averaging,
  [fix ave/chunk](fix_ave_chunk) for spatial or other averaging, and
  [fix print](fix_print) for single-line output of
  [variables](variable).  Fix print can also output to the screen.
* [Restart files](restart).

A simulation prints one set of thermodynamic output and (optionally)
restart files.  It can generate any number of dump files and fix
output files, depending on what [dump](dump) and [fix](fix)
commands you specify.

As discussed below, LAMMPS gives you a variety of ways to determine
what quantities are calculated and printed when the thermodynamics,
dump, or fix commands listed above perform output.  Throughout this
discussion, note that users can also [add their own computes and
fixes to LAMMPS](Modify) which can generate values that can then be
output with these commands.

The following subsections discuss different LAMMPS commands related
to output and the kind of data they operate on and produce:

## Global/per-atom/local/per-grid data

Various output-related commands work with four different "styles" of
data: global, per-atom, local, and per-grid.  A global datum is one or
more system-wide values, e.g. the temperature of the system.  A
per-atom datum is one or more values per atom, e.g. the kinetic energy
of each atom.  Local datums are calculated by each processor based on
the atoms it owns, and there may be zero or more per atom, e.g. a list
of bond distances.

A per-grid datum is one or more values per grid cell, for a grid which
overlays the simulation domain.  Similar to atoms and per-atom data,
the grid cells and the data they store are distributed across
processors; each processor owns the grid cells whose center points
fall within its subdomain.


## Scalar/vector/array data

Global, per-atom, local, and per-grid datums can come in three
"kinds": a single scalar value, a vector of values, or a 2d array of
values.  More specifically these are the valid kinds for each style:

* global scalar
* global vector
* global array
* per-atom vector
* per-atom array
* local vector
* local array
* per-grid vector
* per-grid array

A per-atom vector means a single value per atom; the "vector" is the
length of the number of atoms.  A per-atom array means multiple values
per atom.  Similarly a local vector or array means one or multiple
values per entity (e.g. per bond in the system).  And a per-grid
vector or array means one or multiple values per grid cell.

The doc page for a compute or fix or variable that generates data will
specify both the styles and kinds of data it produces, e.g. a per-atom
vector.  Note that a compute or fix may generate multiple styles and
kinds of output.  However, for per-atom data only a vector or array is
output, never both.  Likewise for per-local and per-grid data.  An
example of a fix which generates multiple styles and kinds of data is
the [fix mdi/qm](fix_mdi_qm) command.  It outputs a global
scalar, global vector, and per-atom array for the quantum mechanical
energy and virial of the system and forces on each atom.

By contrast, different variable styles generate only a single kind of
data: a global scalar for an equal-style variable, global vector for a
vector-style variable, and a per-atom vector for an atom-style
variable.

When data is accessed by another command, as in many of the output
commands discussed below, it can be referenced via the following
bracket notation, where ID in this case is the ID of a compute.  The
leading "c\_" would be replaced by "f\_" for a fix, or "v\_" for a
variable (and ID would be the name of the variable):

+-------------+--------------------------------------------+
| c_ID        | entire scalar, vector, or array            |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------+
| c_ID[I]     | one element of vector, one column of array |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------+
| c_ID[I][J]  | one element of array                       |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------+

Note that using one bracket reduces the dimension of the data once
(vector -> scalar, array -> vector).  Using two brackets reduces the
dimension twice (array -> scalar).  Thus a command that uses scalar
values as input can also conceptually operate on an element of a
vector or array.

Per-grid vectors or arrays are accessed similarly, except that the ID
for the compute or fix includes a grid name and a data name.  This is
because a fix or compute can create multiple grids (of different
sizes) and multiple sets of data (for each grid).  The fix or compute
defines names for each grid and for each data set, so that all of them
can be accessed by other commands.  See the [Howto grid](Howto_grid) doc page for more details.


## Disambiguation

When a compute or fix produces data in multiple styles, e.g. global
and per-atom, a reference to the data can sometimes be ambiguous.
Usually the context in which the input script references the data
determines which style is meant.

For example, if a compute outputs a global vector and a per-atom
array, an element of the global vector will be accessed by using
`c_ID[I]` in [thermodynamic output](thermo_style), while a
column of the per-atom array will be accessed by using `c_ID[I]` in
a [dump custom](dump) command.

However, if a [atom-style variable](variable) references
`c_ID[I]`, then it could be intended to refer to a single element of
the global vector or a column of the per-atom array.  The doc page for
any command that has a potential ambiguity (variables are the most
common) will explain how to resolve the ambiguity.

In this case, an atom-style variables references per-atom data if it
exists.  If access to an element of a global vector is needed (as in
this example), an equal-style variable which references the value can
be defined and used in the atom-style variable formula instead.

Similarly, [thermodynamic output](thermo_style) can only
reference global data from a compute or fix.  But you can indirectly
access per-atom data as follows.  The reference `c_ID[245][2]` for
the ID of a [compute displace/atom](compute_displace_atom)
command, refers to the y-component of displacement for the atom with
ID 245.  While you cannot use that reference directly in the
[thermo_style](thermo_style) command, you can use it an
equal-style variable formula, and then reference the variable in
thermodynamic output.


## Thermodynamic output

The frequency and format of thermodynamic output is set by the
[thermo](thermo), [thermo_style](thermo_style), and
[thermo_modify](thermo_modify) commands.  The [thermo_style](thermo_style) command also specifies what values are calculated and
written out.  Pre-defined keywords can be specified (e.g. press, etotal,
etc).  Three additional kinds of keywords can also be specified (c_ID,
f_ID, v_name), where a [compute](compute) or [fix](fix) or
[variable](variable) provides the value to be output.  In each
case, the compute, fix, or variable must generate global values for
input to the [thermo_style custom](dump) command.

Note that thermodynamic output values can be "extensive" or
"intensive".  The former scale with the number of atoms in the system
(e.g. total energy), the latter do not (e.g. temperature).  The
setting for [thermo_modify norm](thermo_modify) determines whether
extensive quantities are normalized or not.  Computes and fixes
produce either extensive or intensive values; see their individual doc
pages for details.  [Equal-style variables](variable) produce only
intensive values; you can include a division by "natoms" in the
formula if desired, to make an extensive calculation produce an
intensive result.


## Dump file output

Dump file output is specified by the [dump](dump) and
[dump_modify](dump_modify) commands.  There are several
pre-defined formats (dump atom, dump xtc, etc).

There is also a [dump custom](dump) format where the user
specifies what values are output with each atom.  Pre-defined atom
attributes can be specified (id, x, fx, etc).  Three additional kinds
of keywords can also be specified (c_ID, f_ID, v_name), where a
[compute](compute) or [fix](fix) or [variable](variable) provides the values to be output.  In each case, the
compute, fix, or variable must generate per-atom values for input to
the [dump custom](dump) command.

There is also a [dump local](dump) format where the user specifies
what local values to output.  A pre-defined index keyword can be
specified to enumerate the local values.  Two additional kinds of
keywords can also be specified (c_ID, f_ID), where a
[compute](compute) or [fix](fix) or [variable](variable)
provides the values to be output.  In each case, the compute or fix
must generate local values for input to the [dump local](dump)
command.

There is also a [dump grid](dump) format where the user
specifies what per-grid values to output from computes or fixes that
generate per-grid data.


## Fixes that write output files

Several fixes take various quantities as input and can write output
files: [fix ave/time](fix_ave_time), [fix ave/chunk](fix_ave_chunk), [fix ave/histo](fix_ave_histo), [fix
ave/correlate](fix_ave_correlate), and [fix print](fix_print).

The [fix ave/time](fix_ave_time) command enables direct output
to a file and/or time-averaging of global scalars or vectors.  The
user specifies one or more quantities as input.  These can be global
[compute](compute) values, global [fix](fix) values, or
[variables](variable) of any style except the atom style which
produces per-atom values.  Since a variable can refer to keywords used
by the [thermo_style custom](thermo_style) command (like temp or
press) and individual per-atom values, a wide variety of quantities
can be time averaged and/or output in this way.  If the inputs are one
or more scalar values, then the fix generate a global scalar or vector
of output.  If the inputs are one or more vector values, then the fix
generates a global vector or array of output.  The time-averaged
output of this fix can also be used as input to other output commands.

The [fix ave/chunk](fix_ave_chunk) command enables direct output
to a file of chunk-averaged per-atom quantities like those output in
dump files.  Chunks can represent spatial bins or other collections of
atoms, e.g. individual molecules.  The per-atom quantities can be atom
density (mass or number) or atom attributes such as position,
velocity, force.  They can also be per-atom quantities calculated by a
[compute](compute), by a [fix](fix), or by an atom-style
[variable](variable).  The chunk-averaged output of this fix is
global and can also be used as input to other output commands.

Note that the [fix ave/grid](fix_ave_grid) command can also
average the same per-atom quantities within spatial bins, but it does
this for a distributed grid whose grid cells are owned by different
processors.  It outputs per-grid data, not global data, so it is more
efficient for large numbers of averaging bins.

The [fix ave/histo](fix_ave_histo) command enables direct output
to a file of histogrammed quantities, which can be global or per-atom
or local quantities.  The histogram output of this fix can also be
used as input to other output commands.

The [fix ave/correlate](fix_ave_correlate) command enables direct
output to a file of time-correlated quantities, which can be global
values.  The correlation matrix output of this fix can also be used as
input to other output commands.

The [fix print](fix_print) command can generate a line of output
written to the screen and log file or to a separate file, periodically
during a running simulation.  The line can contain one or more
[variable](variable) values for any style variable except the
vector or atom styles).  As explained above, variables themselves can
contain references to global values generated by [thermodynamic
keywords](thermo_style), [computes](compute), [fixes](fix), or other [variables](variable), or to per-atom values
for a specific atom.  Thus the [fix print](fix_print) command is
a means to output a wide variety of quantities separate from normal
thermodynamic or dump file output.


## Computes that process output quantities

The [compute reduce](compute_reduce) and [compute
reduce/region](compute_reduce) commands take one or more per-atom or
local vector quantities as inputs and "reduce" them (sum, min, max,
ave) to scalar quantities.  These are produced as output values which
can be used as input to other output commands.

The [compute slice](compute_slice) command take one or more
global vector or array quantities as inputs and extracts a subset of
their values to create a new vector or array.  These are produced as
output values which can be used as input to other output commands.

The [compute property/atom](compute_property_atom) command takes
a list of one or more pre-defined atom attributes (id, x, fx, etc) and
stores the values in a per-atom vector or array.  These are produced
as output values which can be used as input to other output commands.
The list of atom attributes is the same as for the [dump custom](dump) command.

The [compute property/local](compute_property_local) command
takes a list of one or more pre-defined local attributes (bond info,
angle info, etc) and stores the values in a local vector or array.
These are produced as output values which can be used as input to
other output commands.

The [compute property/grid](compute_property_grid) command takes
a list of one or more pre-defined per-grid attributes (id, grid cell
coords, etc) and stores the values in a per-grid vector or array.
These are produced as output values which can be used as input to the
[dump grid](dump) command.

The [compute property/chunk](compute_property_chunk) command
takes a list of one or more pre-defined chunk attributes (id, count,
coords for spatial bins) and stores the values in a global vector or
array.  These are produced as output values which can be used as input
to other output commands.


## Fixes that process output quantities

The [fix vector](fix_vector) command can create global vectors as
output from global scalars as input, accumulating them one element at
a time.

The [fix ave/atom](fix_ave_atom) command performs time-averaging
of per-atom vectors.  The per-atom quantities can be atom attributes
such as position, velocity, force.  They can also be per-atom
quantities calculated by a [compute](compute), by a [fix](fix), or by an atom-style [variable](variable).  The
time-averaged per-atom output of this fix can be used as input to
other output commands.

The [fix store/state](fix_store_state) command can archive one
or more per-atom attributes at a particular time, so that the old
values can be used in a future calculation or output.  The list of
atom attributes is the same as for the [dump custom](dump)
command, including per-atom quantities calculated by a [compute](compute), by a [fix](fix), or by an atom-style [variable](variable).  The output of this fix can be used as input to other
output commands.

The [fix ave/grid](fix_ave_grid) command performs time-averaging
of either per-atom or per-grid data.

For per-atom data it performs averaging for the atoms within each grid
cell, similar to the [fix ave/chunk](fix_ave_chunk) command when
its chunks are defined as regular 2d or 3d bins.  The per-atom
quantities can be atom density (mass or number) or atom attributes
such as position, velocity, force.  They can also be per-atom
quantities calculated by a [compute](compute), by a [fix](fix), or by an atom-style [variable](variable).

The chief difference between the [fix ave/grid](fix_ave_grid)
and [fix ave/chunk](fix_ave_chunk) commands when used in this
context is that the former uses a distributed grid, while the latter
uses a global grid.  Distributed means that each processor owns the
subset of grid cells within its subdomain.  Global means that each
processor owns a copy of the entire grid.  The [fix ave/grid](fix_ave_grid) command is thus more efficient for large grids.

For per-grid data, the [fix ave/grid](fix_ave_grid) command
takes inputs for grid data produced by other computes or fixes and
averages the values for each grid point over time.


## Computes that generate values to output

Every [compute](compute) in LAMMPS produces either global or
per-atom or local or per-grid values.  The values can be scalars or
vectors or arrays of data.  These values can be output using the other
commands described in this section.  The page for each compute command
describes what it produces.  Computes that produce per-atom or local
or per-grid values have the word "atom" or "local" or "grid as the
last word in their style name.  Computes without the word "atom" or
"local" or "grid" produce global values.


## Fixes that generate values to output

Some [fixes](fix) in LAMMPS produces either global or per-atom
or local or per-grid values which can be accessed by other commands.
The values can be scalars or vectors or arrays of data.  These values
can be output using the other commands described in this section.  The
page for each fix command tells whether it produces any output
quantities and describes them.


## Variables that generate values to output

[Variables](variable) defined in an input script can store one or
more strings.  But equal-style, vector-style, and atom-style or
atomfile-style variables generate a global scalar value, global vector
or values, or a per-atom vector, respectively, when accessed.  The
formulas used to define these variables can contain references to the
thermodynamic keywords and to global and per-atom data generated by
computes, fixes, and other variables.  The values generated by
variables can be used as input to and thus output by the other
commands described in this section.

Per-grid variables have not (yet) been implemented.


## Summary table of output options and data flow between commands

This table summarizes the various commands that can be used for
generating output from LAMMPS.  Each command produces output data of
some kind and/or writes data to a file.  Most of the commands can take
data from other commands as input.  Thus you can link many of these
commands together in pipeline form, where data produced by one command
is used as input to another command and eventually written to the
screen or to a file.  Note that to hook two commands together the
output and input data types must match, e.g. global/per-atom/local
data and scalar/vector/array data.

Also note that, as described above, when a command takes a scalar as
input, that could also be an element of a vector or array.  Likewise a
vector input could be a column of an array.
