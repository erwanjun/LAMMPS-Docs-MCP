# Link LAMMPS as a library to another code

LAMMPS is designed as a library of C++ objects that can be integrated
into other applications, including Python scripts.  The files
`src/library.cpp` and `src/library.h` define a C-style API for using
LAMMPS as a library.  See the [Howto_library](Howto_library) page for a
description of the interface and how to use it for your needs.

The [Build_basics](Build_basics) page explains how to build LAMMPS as either a
shared or static library.  This results in a file in the compilation
folder called `liblammps.a` or `liblammps_<name>.a` in case of
building a static library.  In case of a shared library, the name is the
same only that the suffix is going to be either `.so` or `.dylib` or
`.dll` instead of `.a` depending on the OS.  In some cases, the
`.so` file may be a symbolic link to a file with the suffix `.so.0`
(or some other number).

## Link with LAMMPS as a static library

The calling application can link to LAMMPS as a static library with
compilation and link commands, as in the examples shown below.  These
are examples for a code written in C in the file `caller.c`.
The benefit of linking to a static library is, that the resulting
executable is independent of that library since all required
executable code from the library is copied into the calling executable.

However, it is only as simple as shown above for the case of a plain
LAMMPS library without any optional packages that depend on libraries
(bundled or external) or when using a shared library.  Otherwise, you
need to include all flags, libraries, and paths for the coupled
executable, that are also required to link the LAMMPS executable.

## Link with LAMMPS as a shared library

When linking to LAMMPS built as a shared library, the situation becomes
much simpler, as all dependent libraries and objects are either included
in the shared library or registered as a dependent library in the shared
library file.  Thus, those libraries need not be specified when linking
the calling executable.  Only the `-I` flags are needed.  So the example
case from above of the serial version static LAMMPS library with the
POEMS package installed becomes:

### Locating liblammps.so at runtime

Unlike with a static link, now the `liblammps.so` file is required at
runtime and needs to be in a folder, where the shared linker program of
the operating system can find it.  This would be either a folder like
`/usr/local/lib64` or `${HOME}/.local/lib64` or a folder pointed to
by the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. You can type

```bash
printenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
to see what directories are in that list.

Or you can add the LAMMPS src directory or the directory you performed a
CMake style build in to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable,
so that the current version of the shared library is always available to
programs that use it.

For the Bourne or Korn shells (/bin/sh, /bin/ksh, /bin/bash etc.), you
would add something like this to your `${HOME}/.profile` file:

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH-/usr/lib64}:${HOME}/lammps/src
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
For the csh or tcsh shells, you would equivalently add something like this
to your `${HOME}/.cshrc` file:

```csh
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${HOME}/lammps/src
```
You can verify whether all required shared libraries are found with the
`ldd` tool.  Example:

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/lammps/src ldd caller
     linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffe729e0000)
     liblammps.so => /home/user/lammps/src/liblammps.so (0x00007fc91bb9e000)
     libstdc++.so.6 => /lib64/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007fc91b984000)
     libm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007fc91b83e000)
     libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007fc91b824000)
     libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007fc91b65b000)
     /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fc91c094000)
```
If a required library is missing, you would get a 'not found' entry:

```bash
ldd caller
     linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd672fe000)
     liblammps.so => not found
     libstdc++.so.6 => /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007fb7c7e86000)
     libm.so.6 => /usr/lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007fb7c7d40000)
     libgcc_s.so.1 => /usr/lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007fb7c7d26000)
     libc.so.6 => /usr/lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007fb7c7b5d000)
     /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fb7c80a2000)
```
